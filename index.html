			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<section>
				<p>Welcome to this guide on the basics of how to create a Twitter bot. This guide will teach you how to have a simple bot running in under 30 minutes and hopefully will give you an idea as to the type of things that you can do with your bot. </p>
                <h4>In this guide we will:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Establish what you need to get started</li>
                    <li>Briefly review Twitterâ€™s REST API and touch on their STREAMING API</li>
                    <li>Review the twit library and how it helps us build a bot</li>
                    <li>Analyze some code snippets including how to post, search, and respond to a user "event"</li>
                    <li>End with an example of a simple Twitter Bot</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This guide has the beginner in mind and is designed to help guide those who have never made a Twitter bot before. However, for those who may have created a bot (or multiple), hopefully this guide may introduce you to things that you never knew your bot could do.</p>
